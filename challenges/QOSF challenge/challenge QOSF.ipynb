    "# Challenge: Mentorship Program Screening Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for your interest in the QC Mentorship program!\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to select participants based on how they will manage to do some simple “screening \ttasks” \n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks have been designed to:\n",
    "- find out if you have the skills necessary to succeed in our program.\n",
    "- be doable with basic QC knowledge - nothing should be too hard for you to quickly learn.\n",
    "- allow you to learn some interesting concepts of QC.\n",
    "- give you some choices depending on your interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we mean by skills is not knowledge and expertise in QC. It’s the ability to code, learn new concepts and to meet deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are we looking for in these applications?\n",
    "Coding skills – clear, readable, well-structured code\t\n",
    "Communication – well-described results, easy to understand, tidy.\n",
    "Reliability – submitted on time, all the points from the task description are met\n",
    "Research skills – asking good questions and answering them methodically\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, feel free to be creative – once you finish the basic version of the task, you can expand it. Bonus questions provide just some ideas on how to expand a given topic.\n",

    "## Task 3 Find best results\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem you have the following situation: you are playing a\n",
    "game of tic-tac-toe, and you find the situation in the figure below,\n",
    "next is your turn, develop a quantum algorithm to be able to find the\n",
    "best decisions with higher probability.\n",
    "\n",

    "The following considerations apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You are the X\\'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The matrix as a qubit and the state of the X\\'s is \\|1\\> and of the\n",
    "    > O\\'s is \\|0\\>, of the empty cells an unknown state.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What are the valid combinations to win?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You have at most 2 turns\n",
    "\n",
    "A hint for this exercise should consider all the possible ways to win\n",
    "that (there's 8 of them), for this exercise must obtain with probability\n",
    "the state with the highest probability.\n",

    "\n",
    "for the output only give the status of the empty boxes, you consider\n",
    "this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think the solution is put the values\n",
    "\n",
    "X \\| O \\| O\n",
    "\n",
    "X \\| X \\| X\n",

    "Bonus : what if we start one step earlier and your opponent has not\n",
    "chosen yet, as shown in the following image, it shows with higher\n",
    "probability the chances of you winning. Please refer to the above\n",
